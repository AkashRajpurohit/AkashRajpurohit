# Introduction

A module is a JavaScript files that can export one or more values. These values can be variables, objects, or even functions.

JavaScript does not have built-in support for modules, but the community has created impressive work-arounds. The two most important standards are:

- **CommonJs Modules** - What we know as the `require()` method for importing modules and `module.exports` for exporting. This is designed for synchronous loading and mainly used for server.

- **Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)** - The most popular implementation of this standard is [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/). This is designed for asynchronous loading and mainly used for browsers.

# ES6 Import

The goal for ECMAScript 6 modules was to create a format that both users of CommonJS and of AMD are happy with. The syntax for importing modules looks like this..

```javascript
import Express from 'express'; // for default imports

import { foo } from 'bar'; // for named imports
```

and exporting with named and default exports like this..

```javascript
export const MAX_USERS = 20; // Named exports

function sayHi(name) {
  console.log(`Hi ${name}!`);
}

export default sayHi; // Default export
```

# How to use it

If you try to run this code directly then you would get an error something like

```bash
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

Now, if you are using Node.js version 14.x.x or above then the simplest fix is to add "type": "module" in your package.json file.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

However if you are on any version below 14, you would have to use Babel to compile your code before running it.

**Note: Babel is not framework or platform opinionated. This means that it can be used in any project that is written in JavaScript and thus, in a Node.js project as well.**

Let's start by installing some dev dependencies,

```bash
yarn add -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/node

# OR

npm install -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/node
```

Next is to create a `babel.config.json` file and add the following config,

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

Now you just have to use `babel-node` instead of node, so your start/dev script may look like this now

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon --exec babel-node server.js"
  }
}
```

Hope this was helpful. See you in another one ðŸ‘‹
