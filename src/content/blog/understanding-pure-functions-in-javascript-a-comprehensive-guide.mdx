# Introduction:

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used in many different programming paradigms.

One of these paradigms is functional programming, which emphasizes [immutability](/blog/the-power-of-immutability-in-javascript/), declarative code, and the use of [higher-order functions](/blog/demystifying-higher-order-functions-in-javascript/).

In this article, we will understand one of the key concepts of functional programming which is the use of pure functions.

# What are Pure Functions?

A pure function is a function that, given the same input, always returns the same output, and has no side effects.

> In other words, it does not modify any external state, and it does not depend on any external state.

A pure function is completely self-contained, and its output depends solely on its input.

# Examples of Pure Functions

Let's take a look at some examples of pure functions in JavaScript:

```javascript
// A pure function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// A pure function that takes a string and returns its length
function getLength(str) {
  return str.length;
}

// A pure function that takes an array and returns a new array with all the elements doubled
function doubleArray(arr) {
  return arr.map((num) => num * 2);
}
```

In all of these examples, the functions are pure because they do not modify any external state, and they always return the same output for a given input.

# Benefits of Using Pure Functions

There are several benefits to using pure functions in JavaScript:

- **Predictability:** Because pure functions always return the same output for a given input, they are highly predictable. This makes them easier to reason about, test, and debug.

- **Reusability:** Pure functions can be reused in different parts of your codebase without worrying about side effects or unexpected behavior.

- **Parallelism:** Pure functions can be safely executed in parallel, without the risk of race conditions or other concurrency issues.

- **Testability:** Because pure functions are self-contained and predictable, they are easy to test in isolation.

# Conclusion

Pure functions are an important concept in functional programming, and they can help you write more maintainable, predictable, and testable code in JavaScript.

By avoiding side effects and external state, pure functions make it easier to reason about your code, and they can be reused in different parts of your application.

Try using pure functions in your next project, and see how they can help you write cleaner, more efficient code.
