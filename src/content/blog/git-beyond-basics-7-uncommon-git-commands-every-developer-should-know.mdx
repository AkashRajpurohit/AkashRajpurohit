# Introduction

Git is a powerful tool for version control that allows developers to track changes to their code over time. However, the vast number of Git commands available can be overwhelming, and most developers only use a fraction of them.

In this article, we will explore seven uncommon Git commands that can help you to work more efficiently and effectively.

# Commands

## git stash

The git stash command allows you to temporarily save changes that are not yet ready to be committed.

This can be useful when you need to switch branches or pull in changes from another branch without committing your changes.

Example:

```bash
git stash

Saved working directory and index state WIP on feature-branch: 7f23a8a Add new feature
```

## git bisect

The git bisect command helps you to find the commit that introduced a bug in your code.

You can use this command to quickly locate the commit that caused the bug and fix it.

Example:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good v1.0
```

## git rebase

Git rebase is a command that allows you to rewrite your Git history.

This can be useful if you need to clean up your commit history before merging a branch or if you need to apply a series of commits from one branch to another.

Example:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

## git revert

If you ever need to undo a commit, git revert is the command to use. Unlike git reset, git revert allows you to undo a commit without removing it from your Git history

This is useful if you need to undo a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository.

Example:

```bash
git revert 7f23a8a
```

## git cherry-pick

The git cherry-pick command allows you to apply a single commit from one branch to another.

This can be useful when you need to apply a specific fix or feature to another branch without merging the entire branch.

Example:

```bash
git cherry-pick 7f23a8a
```

## git blame

The git blame command allows you to see who last modified a specific line of code and when.

This can be helpful in identifying the author of a particular bug or issue.

Example:

```bash
git blame index.html
```

## git submodule

The git submodule command allows you to include one Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.

This can be useful when you need to include a shared library or tool in your project.

Example:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

# Conclusion

In this article, we have explored seven uncommon Git commands that can help improve your workflow and productivity. These commands can help you to work more efficiently, troubleshoot issues, and collaborate more effectively with your team.

By incorporating these commands into your daily workflow, you can become a more proficient Git user and take your coding skills to the next level.
