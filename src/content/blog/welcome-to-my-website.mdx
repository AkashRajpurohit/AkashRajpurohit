# Introduction

Hey everyone, welcome to my new website. I've been planning from quite some time to start blogging but never really could take out the time to build this website. So after a long procastination I've finally started my own blogging platform and hopefully you would have a great time here.

# Who Am I?

```javascript
class Akash extends SoftwareDeveloper {
  constructor() {
    this.fullName = 'Akash Rajpurohit';
    this.age = new Date().getFullYear() - 1997;
    this.traits = ['Web Development', 'Mobile Application Development', 'Software Design'];
  }
}
```

You can read more about me in the [About me](/about) section of the site.

# What to expect?

## üí° Software Development Tips and Tricks

So one might ask about what kind of content he/she can expect on this website ü§î. Well I'll mostly be sharing some <u>techniques in software development</u> that I've been learning and applying in my personal and client projects, these could include maybe some <u>code snippets</u> or any series of blogs on certain topics or languages & frameworks.

## üë´ Interview Experiences

Since I'm in my final year of B.E of Engineering üéì, I've been part of a few recruitment processes for different companies. So I'm also planning to share my experiences about the entire process and provide some helpful tips for those who are looking forward to any tech interviews.

## üíª Data Structures and Algorithms Practices

Also I'll start with practice problems on topics like <u>data structures and algorithms</u> which are like the basics and yet the most important topics to cover if you are looking forward to join a good company for a good position and obviously, a good compensation package üí∏

## ü§ì Personal Experiences

<Image src={`/static/images/personal.svg`} width={1296} height={872} />

Now this is something I'm not quite sure what exactly you could expect from this section or types of blogs, but mostly I'll <u>share my journey</u> as a <u>self taught software developer</u> and how I started <u>freelancing</u> and similar technical and non technical blogs. So I'll probably write a few blogs on this section as well in near future.

Since I'm still in my final year I cannot promise anything about the frequency of these blogs. This is something I'm doing just for fun and share my knowledge with other fellow developers out there. But I'll continue with this platform and thats for sure.

# What to do next?

Firstly if you have any topics you want to learn which are kind of overlapping with my domain of work and you want me to cover those in articles, I've kept a <u>comment thread</u> at the end of every post. So you can leave your feedbacks there.

Apart from this if you want a notification on email whenever I publish a new blog article then you can <u>subscribe to the newsletter</u> and you would be notified about any of the upcoming blogs.

Lastly if you like my content, and you really would like to <u>support my work</u>, you can <u>share the article with everyone</u> you feel might benefit from it. I've provided quick buttons to most of the social media platforms so that sharing becomes easy.

So that's it for this welcome post. Hope to see you around. Happy Coding ü§ó
