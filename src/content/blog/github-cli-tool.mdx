# Introduction

Github recently released the beta version of their Github CLI. It's a simple CLI tool that can be used to bring Github concepts (repo, issue, pr) into the terminal.

You can download it at [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/).

# Commands

After installing the cli on your system, just open the terminal and you can use any of these commands

## Issue

```bash
gh issue create
```

It will ask you for the title and the body of the issue

```
Creating pull request for feature-branch into the master in owner/repo
? Title My new issue
? Body [(e) to launch nano, enter to skip]
http://github.com/owner/repo/issues/1
```

Additionally, you can directly use flags to create the issue directly.

```bash
gh issue create --title "Issue Title here" --body "Issue Body here"
```

And you can use the web browser as well to directly open the URL to the page by adding the `--web` flag

```bash
gh issue create --web
```

You can list the issues using

```bash
gh issue list
```

along with some additional flags to filter like open issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open
```

## Pull Requests

Just like issues, you can open PR's as well using the CLI.

```bash
gh pr create
```

And again it also supports using the `--title` and `--body` flags.

The cool part here is that you can view the status of the PR directly in the terminal.

```bash
gh pr status
```

```
Current branch
  There is no pull request associated with [blog/07]

Created by you
  You have no open pull requests

Requesting a code review from you
  You have no pull requests to review
```

## Repo

Cloning a repo using CLI

```bash
gh repo clone <Owner/Repo>
```

Additionally, you can create new repo using

```bash
gh repo create <name>
```

It supports a set of flags like

```
  -d, --description string   Description of the repository
      --enable-issues        Enable issues in the new repository (default true)
      --enable-wiki          Enable wiki in the new repository (default true)
  -h, --homepage string      Repository home page URL
      --public               Make the new repository public
  -t, --team string          The name of the organization team to be granted access
```

Along with creating repos, you can even fork any repo using this tool.

```bash
gh repo fork <repository>
```

And at the very least, open/view any repo in the browser using

```bash
gh repo view <repository>
```

- Note - If no `repository` is mentioned, it forks/views the current repository, that is the folder in which you are using the repo if it is initialized as a git repository remotely.
