summary: 'As a Linux server administrator, you may have already learned the basics of Linux commands. However, to manage your server more efficiently, you need to dive deeper into the lesser-known, but equally important intermediate-level commands. In this article, we will cover some of the intermediate-level Linux commands that will help you become a more proficient Linux sysadmin.'

# Introduction

As a sysadmin, you often come across complex tasks that require more than just basic commands. That's why it's important to learn some intermediate-level Linux commands that can make your work easier and more efficient.

These commands can help you automate repetitive tasks, manage processes, and monitor system performance, among other things. In this article, we will explore some of these commands and their usage.

<Callout title="Pro Tip!">
	Just like the [previous article](/blog/essential-linux-commands-for-server-maintenance-at-home/) dropping in a friendly advice that refer to man pages for learning more in detail about each commands using the `man <command_name>`

# Monitoring and Performance

- **sar** - The sar command is used to collect, report, and save system activity information.

  It is helpful for monitoring system performance and diagnosing issues.

  ```bash
  sar -u 5 10
  ```

  This command will display CPU utilization statistics every 5 seconds, 10 times.

- **atop** - The atop command is used to monitor system resources and processes.

  It provides a detailed view of the system activity and helps in identifying performance bottlenecks.

  ```bash
  atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_20230301
  ```

  This command will display the system activity for a specific date.

- **free** - Display the amount of free and used memory in the system.

  ```bash
  free -h
  ```

  This will display the data in a human-readable format.

# Process Management

- **ps** - Display information about the currently running processes.

  ```bash
  ps -aux
  ```

- **kill** - Send a signal to a process, which can be used to terminate the process.

  ```bash
  kill -9 1234
  ```

  This will kill the process which has the `PID` of 1234

- **pkill** - Kill processes based on their name or other attributes.

  ```bash
  pkill -f firefox
  ```

  This will kill the firefox process.

- **nice** - nice command is used to set the priority of a process.

  It is often used to give lower priority to CPU-intensive processes so that they don't hog the system resources.

  ```bash
  nice -5 wget https://akashrajpurohit.com
  ```

  To set negative priority you can use a double hyphen

  ```bash
  nice --5 wget https://akashrajpurohit.com
  ```

- **renice** - Change the priority of an already running process.

  ```bash
  renice +5 1234
  ```

  This will change the priority of the process with `PID` 1234.

- **top** - Displays real-time information about running processes and system resources.

  ```bash
  top
  ```

# Networking Commands

- **traceroute** - Traces the route taken by packets over an IP network.

  ```bash
  traceroute google.com
  ```

- **tcpdump** - Captures network traffic in real-time and saves it to a file.

  ```bash
  tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
  ```

- **netstat** - Displays information about network connections, routing tables, and network interfaces.

  ```bash
  netstat -ano | grep ESTABLISHED
  ```

- **nmap** - Scans a network and discovers open ports and services.

  ```bash
  nmap -sS -O 192.168.1.1/24
  ```

# Disk Management

- **lsof** - The lsof command is used to list open files on the system. It is helpful for identifying processes that are using a specific file or disk partition.

  ```bash
  lsof /dev/sda1
  ```

  This command will list all processes that are using the /dev/sda1 disk partition.

- **blkid** - The blkid command is used to display information about block devices. It is helpful for identifying disk partitions and their properties.

  ```bash
  blkid /dev/sda1
  ```

  This command will display the properties of the `/dev/sda1` disk partition.

- **fdisk** - fdisk command is used to list, create, delete, or modify partitions on a hard disk.

  ```bash
  fdisk -l
  ```

  This command will list the partition tables for the hard drive.

# Miscellaneous Commands

- **sed** - A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.

  ```bash
  sed 's/foo/bar/g' input.txt > output.txt
  ```

- **awk** - A versatile programming language for text processing and data extraction.

  ```bash
  cat access.log | awk '{ print $1 }'
  ```

- **tar** - A utility for creating and manipulating tar archives.

  ```bash
  tar -czvf archive.tar.gz file1 file2 dir1
  ```

- **find** - Searches for files and directories that match certain criteria.

  ```bash
  find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
  ```

# Conclusion

These are some of the intermediate-level Linux commands that a system admin may use while maintaining a Linux server.

However, this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many more commands that you can explore as you become more experienced with Linux administration.
