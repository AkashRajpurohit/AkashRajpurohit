Hey! My name is Akash Rajpurohit. Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). I am working in the Workspaces team and building products around collaboration tools at Postman.

Previously I have worked at a company called [Cimpress](https://cimpress.com) and an Ed-tech startup called [PeopleGrove](https://peoplegrove.com).

In my free time, I like to watch animes/web series, listen to music (and very early stage of learning piano), read and explore new stuff in tech and try out new technologies to build fun side projects, and spend time with friends and family.

You can read more about my [journey on my resume page](/resume/) and the [equipment and software I use](/uses/) on daily basis as a software engineer.

Here are some other things about me that you might want to know:

- I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [VCET](https://vcet.edu.in). I've specialized in Information Technology.
- I started a YouTube channel called [The IT Guy](https://www.youtube.com/TheITGuy) during my college days where I would put videos on basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stuff.
- I worked on my first serious project (a freelance project) in the year 2019. I worked with my old friends in building an [POS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale) using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) Framework.
- During my college days, I participated in quite a few coding competitions & hackathons and it was one of the best experiences I've had with trying out the new technology stack and new ideas, and of course the hackathon [swag](https://youtu.be/z9eIgg0ArDg?t=10) and the prizes.
- I also started working as a part-time teacher (majorly before starting engineering), mostly to kill the time and try something new.
- Also [Death Note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note) was the first anime that I watched and it's still one of my favorites
