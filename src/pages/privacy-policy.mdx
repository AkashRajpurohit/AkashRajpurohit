# Privacy

The site explicitly does not collect any user-specific data in any way. The current scope of the site does not allow users to create an account hence no user data like name, or email is stored on the site's database. The site's database however stores information about the total visitor count (just the numeric counter) for certain pages like `blogs` and `snippets` and likes counters. To keep track of unique users we store a randomly generated user id on the client itself which does not have any PII information attached to the user.

For newsletter management, I was earlier using Revue by Twitter. Now since Revue have been shut down, I have exported the existing subscribers and new subscribers into the new system (undecided yet). But the data for this would remain solely with me and will not be shared with others. By subscribing to the newsletter you allow me to send you emails from time to time with an option to unsubscribe from the list in the future.

I use a self-hosted web analytics tool called [Umami](https://umami.is). The data for analytics is stored on a PostgreSQL database managed by [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (Which only I have access to). The data stored via Umami does not contain any PII of users and is only used to better understand the usage of the site and the content so that necessary improvements can be made.

For the comments system, I am using [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) which allows authenticated users via Github to post comments. I do not own the Giscus app bot and am using the official provided bot which has access to read your email address. This information is not stored by me in any format and all comments are stored on the GitHub database.

The site integrates [Carbon ads](https://www.carbonads.net/) which are displayed on certain pages. I know, I hate ads too but these are added only to keep the site sustainable.

# Terms

Everything on akashrajpurohit.com is provided free of charge and therefore there is no promise this will continue. I'll do my best to keep things going and preserve the data, but that's a plan, not a promise.

# How you can support me best

I appreciate that you're even reading this section, so that's a nice support in itself ðŸ˜Š. If you want to support me, you can share the [articles](/blogs/) that I publish with people who might find them interesting and helpful and can probably tag me if you wish to. If you wish to financially support me then you could also send me a one-time tip at my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/akashrajpurohit) account or directly at [paypal.me/RajpurohitAkash](https://paypal.me/RajpurohitAkash)

# Conclusion

I hope this page gives you an idea of what my incentives are and if you're one of the terrific people who benefit from the free stuff I hope you use that to make your corner of the world a better place. If you're one of the people helping me keep this sustainable by giving me money in one way or another then I thank you all the more.

Please keep in mind that even when financial incentives are at play, I try my best to be a self-aware, authentic, and genuine person. Please assume the enthusiasm you see from me about a particular topic is genuine even if there is a bit of a financial incentive.

Take care!
